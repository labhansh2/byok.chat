## TODO

- [x] Prompt Input
- [x] OpenRouter
- [x] Better Model Selector
- [x] Auth
- [ ] DB
- [ ] peacock renderer
- [ ] extensions
- [ ] org engine
- [ ] theme gen
- [ ] extension stack
- [ ] add newer models

### Few ideas on Extensions

- [ ] view components
  - if you generate code for components in your chat you
    should be able to view the component rendered on your screen
- [ ] mermaid
- [ ] manim maybe
- [ ] web view
  - if therer is a link that is embeddable you should be able to
    view the web for that link
